## ANALYTICS MENTORSHIP PROGRAMME

#### Working on the Data Challenge

1. Fork the code challenge repository provided.

2. Make a topic branch. In your github form, keep the master branch clean. When you create a branch, it essentially will be a copy of the master.

Pull all changes, make sure your repository is up to date

`$ cd analytics_mentorship`

`$ git pull origin master`

Create a new branch as follows-> git checkout -b [assignment_no], e.g.

`$ git checkout -b assignment_one master`

See all branches created

`$ git branch`

`* assignment_one`

`  master`

Push the new branch to github

`$ git push origin -u assignment_one`

3. Remember to only make changes to the fork!

4. Commit the changes to your fork.

5. Make a pull request to the analytics_mentorship Repo.
